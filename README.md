# Deep-Learning Algorithm Development using Python and TensorFlow

1. Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)  <br />
2. train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning. <br />
3. Writing efficient vectorized code with numpy  <br />
4. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier  <br />
5. Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier  <br />
6. Softmax classifier  <br />
7. Two layer neural network classifier  <br />
8. Differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers <br />
9. Performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features) <br />
10. Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures <br />
11. Vectorized backpropagation <br />
12. Update rules used to optimize Neural Networks  <br />
13. Batch normalization for training deep networks <br />
14. Dropout to regularize networks <br />
15. Cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture <br />
16. Architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and train gain experience with training these models on data <br />
