# Deep-Learning Algorithm Development using Python and Tensor Flow

Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
Writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
Softmax classifier
Two layer neural network classifier
Differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
Performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
Vectorized backpropagation
Update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
Batch normalization for training deep networks
Dropout to regularize networks
Cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture
Architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and train gain experience with training these models on data
